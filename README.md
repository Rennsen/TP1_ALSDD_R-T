# Practical Work N°1: Linked List

This project is a collaborative effort between Rayan Derradji and Tarek Ait Ahmed for the Practical Work N°1 on Linked List.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to implement a search algorithm for finding prime numbers up to a specified number, using linked lists and dynamic arrays. We employ the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers and then explore various operations on them.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components:

1. **Search Algorithm Implementation**: We start by implementing the search algorithm without using any data structures.

2. **Data Structure Implementation**: We then implement two data structures, namely dynamic arrays and linked lists, to store and manipulate the prime numbers.

3. **Range Indexing**: We implement functionality to index the list by range, allowing for efficient retrieval of prime numbers between according to the input range.

4. **Prime Factorization**: We use the list of prime numbers to express each number from the initial list as a product of prime numbers, storing the divisors in the respective nodes.

5. **Co-prime Number Detection**: We develop a mechanism to find co-prime numbers among the generated prime numbers.

6. **Complexity and Iteration Analysis**: We measure the complexity and number of iterations involved in the various operations to assess the performance of our implementation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rennsen/TP1_ALSDD_R-T.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Code::Blocks.

3. Get rid of all the folders except the folder titled `CodeBlocks`.

4. Navigate to the respective files for each question and review the implementation.

5. Build and run the project to observe the output and performance metrics.
